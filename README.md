we explore the fascinating world of geometry and mathematical calculations. In front of you is a menu that unlocks the secrets behind various shapes and their properties. Let's take a brief journey through the options:

Firstly, we have the "Area of Circle." Imagine being able to effortlessly find the space enclosed by a circle, just by knowing its radius. Next, we can delve into the "Circumference of Circle," revealing the total length around the circle.

Moving on, the "Area of Rectangle" awaits your exploration. With this option, you can easily determine the space within a rectangle using its length and width. For those intrigued by three-dimensional shapes, the "Volume of Sphere" and "Surface Area of Sphere" options offer insights into the inner and outer properties of a sphere.

The "Area of Square" calculation is straightforward â€“ providing the area based on the length of its side. For those interested in triangles, the "Area of Right Angled Triangle" and "Area of Equilateral Triangle" options offer solutions using base, height, and side length.

Additionally, we have practical applications like the "Perimeter of Rectangle," providing the total length around a rectangle, and the "Area of Triangle" for yet another triangular exploration.

Lastly, should you wish to conclude your mathematical journey, simply select "Exit" at any time.
